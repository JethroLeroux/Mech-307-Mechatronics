# Mech-307-Mechatronics
A project I did for a mechatronics class. It is an alarm clock with spinning arms that go off when the alarm goes off. The alarm also has the option to activate when the Arduino senses sunlight i.e. at sunrise. All parts designed and 3D printed by myself using PLA. Arduino code was adapted from online, the source is in the comments of the code.
